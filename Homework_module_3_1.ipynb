            "\n",
            "Проблема в том, что большинство документов - PDF, Word, HTML - не имеют четкой структуры, понятной нейросетям. Коммерческие парсеры решают эту задачу, но возникают вопросы безопасности данных, стоимости и качества обработки сложных элементов вроде таблиц и графиков. Здесь на помощь приходит Docling - открытый инструмент для локального парсинга документов.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Что такое Docling\n",
            "\n",
            "Docling - это open-source проект от IBM Research, предназначенный для преобразования документов различных форматов в структурированные данные, готовые для работы с ИИ. Инструмент поддерживает PDF, Word (DOCX), PowerPoint (PPTX), HTML и даже изображения, конвертируя их в Markdown или JSON. Проект набрал огромную популярность на GitHub благодаря продвинутым возможностям и полностью бесплатному локальному использованию.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Архитектура и принципы работы\n",
            "\n",
            "Архитектура Docling построена на трех ключевых компонентах. Первый - набор парсеров, где каждый парсер выбирается в зависимости от типа входного документа. Второй компонент определяет структуру распарсенного контента, выявляя объекты внутри документа и объединяя их в логические блоки. Третий этап - формирование векторных представлений на основе выделенных структурных единиц.\n",
            "\n",
            "Процесс обработки начинается с PDF-бэкенда, который извлекает программные текстовые токены с их координатами на странице и создает растровое изображение каждой страницы. Затем стандартный модельный пайплайн применяет последовательность AI-моделей к каждой странице для извлечения особенностей контента, таких как структура таблиц и макет документа. На финальной стадии результаты со всех страниц агрегируются и проходят через постобработку, которая добавляет метаданные, определяет язык документа и формирует типизированный объект документа.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Преимущества структурированного парсинга\n",
            "\n",
            "Критическое преимущество Docling заключается в том, что векторизация происходит строго по структуре документа, что предотвращает разрыв логических блоков на части. Это обеспечивает высокое качество векторного поиска и извлечения чанков из базы данных. Система также способна обрабатывать сложные случаи, когда таблицы разделены между несколькими страницами - Docling сохраняет общий контекст и воспринимает это как единый объект.\n",
            "\n",
            "Docling использует OCR и распознавание объектов для анализа макета, что позволяет сохранить целостность структуры таблиц даже когда график или таблица занимает несколько страниц. Инструмент собирает документ в стандартизированный формат Docling, который затем экспортируется в JSON или Markdown для использования в векторных базах данных и системах вопросов-ответов.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Практическая реализация\n",
            "\n",
            "Базовая настройка Docling максимально проста. Процесс начинается с инициализации конвертера, передачи ему документа и указания нужного формата вывода - обычно Markdown. Установка производится через менеджер пакетов: `pip install docling` .\n",
            "\n",
            "После установки Docling через команду pip install docling инструмент готов к работе двумя способами: через интерфейс командной строки (CLI) для быстрых операций и через Python API для программной интеграции в проекты. Оба подхода обеспечивают полный доступ к функциональности парсинга документов.\n",
